# GrocerEats速

GrocerEats速 is a mobile application designed to connect buyers with local producers and shops. Buyers can search for nearby shops, view available stock, and place orders, while sellers can register their shops, manage inventory, and track orders. The app integrates with Google Maps to provide users with a map-based view of nearby shops.

## Architecture

GrocerEats速 uses a combination of Monolithic and NLayer architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer (Flutter)**: Handles the mobile app UI for buyers and sellers, as well as Google Maps integration for displaying nearby shops.
2. **Backend (Django)**: Combines the business logic and data access layers. Django handles both:
   - **Business Logic**: Manages all business rules, such as user authentication, shop management, stock updates, and order processing.
   - **Data Access**: Interfaces directly with PostgreSQL to fetch and store data related to users, shops, inventory, and orders.
3. **Database Layer (PostgreSQL)**: Stores all core application data, including user accounts, shop details, products, and orders.
